# Design of a SCARA 3-Dof robot manupilator with 1 DoF wrist

## Objective:  
This report presents a design and analysis of a SCARA robot using the theoretical concepts of DH parameters, Forward kinematics, Inverse kinematics implemented in Robotics, Vision & Control: (c) Peter Corke 1992-2019 http://www.petercorke.com, Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (release 10.3.1) 
 
## Task:  
The expected task performance is to pick an object [Red Piece] and place it on another object [Green Piece] which in the workspace of the designed robot.  

 
## Data given: 
The base of the robot and the position of the center of bottom surface of each object was given as data.
